empty: constant false
vertex: two inputs, initially of constant false, if inputs already set, then update their values accordingly
overlay: take the union of all inputs, outputs, vertices, and edges
connect: discard the second set of inputs. take the union of both output sets. for every logic gate, 

graph structure: list of inputs, logic gates themselves, list of outputs

issues: 
two connections from the same node to the same node
inputs and outputs can all feed into/off of the same node
workaround:
create intermediate node (node 2.0,2.1,etc)
