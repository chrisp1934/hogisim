## High-Level Project Description
Our group plans to build a digital logic sandbox where users can construct digital circuits using the seven fundamental logic gates: NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, XNOR. The sandbox is empty in the beginning. The user can populate the board with multiple instances of fundamental logic gates, an input node which the user can toggle to either 0 or 1, or an output node that is updated at execution. This tool can serve as a playground for users interested in digital logic or as an educational tool.

## Goals
The goal for the project involves a visual environment, wherein a user can place sprites corresponding to logic gates and other related components on a two-dimensional grid. The user will use these sprites to construct a composite digital circuit, which can then be executed with particular input and display the expected output for the circuit. The user should be able to freely modify and rerun the circuit in real time. The controls should be intuitive after a short learning period and the user experience should be smooth.

## Features
- Modular construction: The user can create individual instances of each type of logic gate and connect them together within specified limitations (see below).
- Simulation: The sandbox environment can be simulated and an output generated by the user's circuit.
- Keyboard interface: The user can use keyboard shortcuts to make navigation and placement more intuitive.

## Potential Features
- Export to file: The user would be able to export their circuit diagram to a file and then import diagrams to new environments as desired.
- Abstraction: The user would be able to combine circuits into a ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù and then be able to use that circuits functionality without having to repeatedly use all the required logic gates.

## Limitations
- Only support for combinational circuits. (ex. basic gates, multiplexers, and arithmetic circuits etc.)
- A to-be determined sizing limitation of the circuit
